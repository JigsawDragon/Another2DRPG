## INFO
I created this 2D RPG game like the other one on my portfolio. Rather than using click to move mechanics, it uses free tile movement. The game looks very odd when you run it because you would immediately see
a broken attempt at an inventory system. If you walk to the amulet on the right side of the room it should add it to your inventory. The stairs on the top right have been implemented as well. It takes you to a 
camera-locked location which makes it look like a second room and the walls have been coded into objects. It is again an unfinished project that I did a few years ago, but I thought that it would serve as something
interesting to put up here to show what I tried to do, and how far I got. The chances of me revisiting this project are low, and even if I do it would most likely be in the further future.
